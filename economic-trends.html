        <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-700 mb-4">Key Economic Indicators</h3>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-lg text-gray-800 mb-4">
          <li><strong>Gross Domestic Product (GDP):</strong> Measures the overall economic output of a country. A growing GDP often signals a healthy economy, while a declining GDP can indicate recession.</li>
          <li><strong>Inflation Rate:</strong> Tracks the rate at which prices for goods and services rise. Moderate inflation is typical of a growing economy, but high inflation can erode purchasing power.</li>
          <li><strong>Interest Rates:</strong> Set by central banks, these influence borrowing costs and consumer spending. Lower interest rates often encourage investment and spending.</li>
          <li><strong>Unemployment Rate:</strong> Indicates the percentage of the labor force that is jobless but actively seeking work. High unemployment can signal economic trouble.</li>
          <li><strong>Consumer Confidence Index (CCI):</strong> Measures consumer sentiment. A high CCI suggests optimism, which often leads to increased spending and investment.</li>
        </ul>
